# Automation-Script-for-joining-classes-Selenium-
I have hard coded my time table and class links in this script.
This scripts takes the date and day from the pc ans according to the day it joins the classes.
It is recommended to use the latest driver for your browser.
Also it wont work if two step authentication is enabled on your account.
This script was created according to google meet and was created in march 2018. If tags/xpath for various features are changed by google then it will be required to update the tags and xpaths in the script as well.
